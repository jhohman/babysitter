# Babysitter Kata

An object oriented implementation of the Babysitter kata in Java. While doing the kata 
I have intentionally committed early and often in an attempt to show the evolution of 
the design.

I started with Story tests, or End to End tests, which guided me to the implementation
before refactoring to a more object oriented design. The restriction of representing
time as integers on a 12 hour clock provides a great challenge and I chose this approach 
based on that challenge.
